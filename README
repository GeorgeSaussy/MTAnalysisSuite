See in-line documentation and the writeup to see how the program works.

This is the Analysis Suite. To get data for a microtubule, open begin.m and hit run. Select the .mat file for the MT you wish to analyse. The program should automatically do the work for you.

Additional functions can be found in other_funcitons. These are untested and unverified.
